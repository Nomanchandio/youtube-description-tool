# Lambda Function for Handling Request Data

This project contains the source code for a Lambda function that handles incoming requests, extracts relevant data from the request body, and constructs a response with the processed data. 

## Functionality

The Lambda function `lambda_handler` takes an event and context as input, where the event represents the incoming request. The function parses the JSON data from the request body, which typically includes information such as details about a video, timestamps, channel information, other related videos, information about products, website links, and contact links.

After extracting the necessary data, the function constructs a response body containing the processed information. This response body is then returned with a 200 status code and a JSON format suitable for API responses.

## Usage

To use this Lambda function:

1. Deploy the function to your AWS Lambda environment.
2. Configure an API Gateway trigger to invoke the Lambda function.
3. Send POST requests with JSON data in the request body to the API endpoint associated with the Lambda function.

## Deployment

To deploy the Lambda function, you can use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or any other preferred deployment method for AWS Lambda functions. Make sure to set up appropriate permissions for the Lambda function to access the necessary resources and handle incoming requests.

## Sample Request Body

Here is an example of a sample JSON request body that can be sent to the Lambda function:

```json
{
    "about_video": "Introduction to AWS Lambda",
    "timestamps": ["00:01:30", "00:05:45"],
    "about_channel": "MyTechChannel",
    "other_videos": ["AWS Lambda Best Practices", "Getting Started with API Gateway"],
    "about_products": ["AWS SDKs", "CloudFormation Templates"],
    "website_link": "https://example.com",
    "contact_links": ["support@example.com", "twitter.com/example"]
}
Replace the values in the JSON object with the actual data you want to send for processing.

Response Format
The Lambda function returns a JSON response with the processed data in the following format:

json
{
    "about_video": "Introduction to AWS Lambda",
    "timestamps": ["00:01:30", "00:05:45"],
    "about_channel": "MyTechChannel",
    "other_videos": ["AWS Lambda Best Practices", "Getting Started with API Gateway"],
    "about_products": ["AWS SDKs", "CloudFormation Templates"],
    "website_link": "https://example.com",
    "contact_links": ["support@example.com", "twitter.com/example"]
}
Error Handling
The Lambda function handles various error scenarios such as missing required data in the request body. If any error occurs during request processing, an appropriate error response will be returned.
